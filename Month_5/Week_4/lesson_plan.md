# Month 5, Week 4: Lesson Plan

## Topic: Generative Models

### Objectives:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- Explore different types of GANs (e.g., DCGAN, Conditional GAN).
- Learn about Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their applications.
- Introduce other generative models like Autoregressive Models and Flow-based Models.

### Activities:
- Lecture on GANs: Generator, Discriminator, training process, and challenges.
- Practical exercise: Implementing a simple GAN for image generation.
- Discussion on VAEs: Encoder, Decoder, latent space, and reconstruction loss.
- Overview of recent advancements and applications of generative models.

### Homework:
- Research and present on a specific application of GANs (e.g., style transfer, super-resolution).
- Implement a basic VAE for data generation or anomaly detection.
