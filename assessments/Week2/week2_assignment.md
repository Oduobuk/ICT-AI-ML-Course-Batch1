# Week 2 Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Visualization

## üìã Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you'll work with a real-world dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create meaningful visualizations. You'll demonstrate your ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using the tools and techniques covered in Week 2.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:
1. Load and explore a real-world dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data using pandas
3. Perform exploratory data analysis
4. Create effective visualizations
5. Draw meaningful insights from the data

## üìÇ Dataset

You'll be working with the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2021.

Dataset source: [Kaggle - Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## üìù Tasks

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration (15 points)
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
- Print the shape of the dataset
- Display basic information about the dataset (data types, non-null counts, etc.)
- Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns

### 2. Data Cleaning (20 points)
- Handle missing values appropriately (explain your approach)
- Convert data types if necessary
- Remove or handle any duplicate entries
- Create any new features that might be useful for analysis
- Document any data quality issues you identify

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (30 points)
Perform at least 5 different analyses to understand the data. Examples include:
- Distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows)
- Top countries producing content on Netflix
- Most common genres
- Release trends over the years
- Content rating distribution
- Relationship between different variables

For each analysis:
- Explain what question you're trying to answer
- Show the code and results
- Provide a brief interpretation of the findings

### 4. Data Visualization (25 points)
Create at least 4 different visualizations that effectively communicate insights from the data. Your visualizations should include:
- At least one univariate plot (e.g., histogram, box plot)
- At least one bivariate plot (e.g., scatter plot, bar plot)
- At least one multivariate plot (e.g., heatmap, pair plot)
- At least one interactive visualization using Plotly

For each visualization:
- Write a clear title and labels
- Use appropriate colors and styles
- Include a brief interpretation of what the visualization shows

### 5. Insights and Recommendations (10 points)
Based on your analysis, provide:
- 3-5 key insights about the Netflix content library
- 2-3 recommendations for Netflix based on your findings
- Any limitations of your analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- Use Python 3.8+
- Use Jupyter Notebook for your analysis
- Include markdown cells to explain your approach and findings
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use the following libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## üì§ Submission Instructions

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook named `netflix_analysis_<your_name>.ipynb`
2. Organize your notebook with clear sections and markdown cells
3. Ensure all code cells execute without errors
4. Include both the code and its output in the notebook
5. Export the notebook to HTML format
6. Submit both the .ipynb and .html files
7. Also submit a PDF version of your notebook

## üìÖ Due Date

**Due:** End of Week 2 (Sunday 11:59 PM)

## üìù Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Code Quality and Organization | 10 |
| Data Cleaning and Preparation | 20 |
| Exploratory Data Analysis | 30 |
| Data Visualization | 25 |
| Insights and Recommendations | 10 |
| Documentation and Readability | 5 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## üí° Tips for Success

- Start early to allow time for data exploration
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks
- Test your code frequently
- Use version control (git) to track your changes
- Review the rubric to ensure you meet all requirements
- Ask for help if you get stuck
