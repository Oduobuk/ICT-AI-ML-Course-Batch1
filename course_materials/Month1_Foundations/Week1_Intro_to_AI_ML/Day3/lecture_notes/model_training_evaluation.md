# Model Training and Evaluation

## The Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Problem Definition
2. Data Collection
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Model Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Deployment

## Training vs Testing Data
- Importance of data splitting
- Common splits (80/20, 70/30, etc.)
- Cross-validation techniques

## Model Evaluation Metrics
### Classification
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC

### Regression
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared

## Overfitting and Underfitting
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Regularization techniques
- Cross-validation

## Practical Considerations
- Feature scaling
- Handling imbalanced data
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Model Persistence
- Saving and loading models
- Model versioning
- Deployment considerations

## Exercises
1. Train a simple classifier
2. Evaluate model performance
3. Tune hyperparameters
4. Save and load a trained model
