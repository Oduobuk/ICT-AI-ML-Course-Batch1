## 🏆 Assignments

### Weekly Project: Customer Churn Analysis
Analyze a customer churn dataset and create a comprehensive report with visualizations.

**Deliverables:**
1. Jupyter Notebook with your analysis
2. Interactive dashboard (using Plotly Dash or Streamlit)
3. Short report summarizing your findings

**Due:** End of Week 2

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Practice regularly**: Try to implement the code examples yourself
2. **Experiment**: Modify the code and see how it affects the output
3. **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're stuck
4. **Review**: Go through the materials multiple times to reinforce your understanding
5. **Build a portfolio**: Save your best visualizations and analyses for your portfolio

## 📅 Upcoming Deadlines

- **Friday EOD**: Submit Week 1 assignments (if not already submitted)
- **Next Monday**: Quiz on Pandas and Data Visualization
- **Next Friday**: Submit Week 2 project
