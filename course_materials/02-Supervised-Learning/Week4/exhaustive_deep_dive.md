# Month 2, Week 4: Boosting and SVM - Exhaustive Deep Dive

## Boosting Algorithms

### Theoretical Explanation

Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that is used to improve the performance of a model by sequentially training a series of weak learners. Each weak learner is trained to correct the errors of the previous weak learners.

*   **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):** A boosting algorithm that works by assigning weights to each training instance. The weights are updated at each iteration, with the weights of the misclassified instances being increased. This forces the subsequent weak learners to focus on the instances that are difficult to classify.
*   **Gradient Boosting:** A boosting algorithm that works by fitting a new weak learner to the residuals of the previous weak learner. The residuals are the difference between the actual values and the predicted values.

### Code Snippets

**Scikit-Learn:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier

# AdaBoost
adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=100)
adaboost.fit(X, y)

# Gradient Boosting
gradient_boosting = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
gradient_boosting.fit(X, y)
```

## XGBoost/LightGBM Internals

### Theoretical Explanation

XGBoost and LightGBM are two popular gradient boosting libraries that are known for their high performance and efficiency.

*   **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** A gradient boosting library that uses a number of techniques to improve performance, including parallelization, tree pruning, and handling missing values.
*   **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):** A gradient boosting library that is designed to be fast and efficient. It uses a number of techniques to achieve this, including gradient-based one-side sampling and exclusive feature bundling.

### Code Snippets

**XGBoost:**

```python
import xgboost as xgb

# XGBoost
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100)
xgb_model.fit(X, y)
```

**LightGBM:**

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

# LightGBM
lgb_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100)
lgb_model.fit(X, y)
```

## Support Vector Machines (SVM) Optimization

### Theoretical Explanation

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

*   **Hyperplane:** A line or a plane that separates the data into different classes.
*   **Margin:** The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points.
*   **Support Vectors:** The data points that are closest to the hyperplane.

**Optimization Problem:**

The goal of SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin. This can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem.

## Kernel Trick

### Theoretical Explanation

The kernel trick is a technique that is used to handle non-linearly separable data. It works by implicitly mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space where it is linearly separable.

*   **Kernel Function:** A function that computes the dot product of the data points in the higher-dimensional space without explicitly mapping the data into that space.
*   **Common Kernel Functions:**
    *   **Polynomial Kernel:** A kernel function that is based on the polynomial function.
    *   **RBF Kernel (Radial Basis Function Kernel):** A kernel function that is based on the Gaussian function.
    *   **Sigmoid Kernel:** A kernel function that is based on the sigmoid function.

## Soft Margin SVM

### Theoretical Explanation

A soft margin SVM is a variation of SVM that allows for some misclassifications. This can be useful for handling noisy data and for improving the generalization of the model.

*   **Regularization Parameter C:** A parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the number of misclassifications.
    *   **Small C:** A small value of C will result in a wider margin and more misclassifications.
    *   **Large C:** A large value of C will result in a narrower margin and fewer misclassifications.
