# Month 2, Week 1: Linear Regression

## Lesson Plan

*   **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression:**
    *   **Concept:** Understand the fundamental concepts of linear regression for predicting continuous outcomes.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to build and train a simple and a multiple linear regression model.

*   **Cost Function and Gradient Descent:**
    *   **Concept:** Learn how models are optimized by minimizing a cost function using gradient descent.
    *   **Hands-on:** Implement simple linear regression from scratch using NumPy and gradient descent.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Concept:** Discover how to assess the performance of regression models using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
    *   **Hands-on:** Calculate and interpret the evaluation metrics for your regression models.

*   **Polynomial Regression and Overfitting:**
    *   **Concept:** Explore how to model non-linear relationships and the importance of avoiding overfitting.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to build and train a polynomial regression model. Visualize the bias-variance trade-off.
