# Month 2, Week 2: Logistic Regression and KNN

## Lesson Plan

*   **Logistic Regression for Binary Classification:**
    *   **Concept:** Understand its purpose and how it differs from linear regression.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to build and train a logistic regression model.

*   **Decision Boundary, Sigmoid Function, and Interpreting Coefficients:**
    *   **Concept:** Explore the core components of logistic regression.
    *   **Hands-on:** Visualize the decision boundary of a logistic regression model.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Concept:** Learn how to assess the performance of classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC curve.
    *   **Hands-on:** Calculate and interpret the evaluation metrics for your classification models.

*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    *   **Concept:** Introduce a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to build and train a KNN model. Experiment with different values of 'k'.

## Assignments

*   **Assignment 1: Logistic Regression from Scratch**
    *   Generate a synthetic dataset for binary classification.
    *   Implement logistic regression from scratch using NumPy and gradient descent.
    *   Train your model on the synthetic dataset and visualize the decision boundary.

*   **Assignment 2: Classification with Scikit-Learn**
    *   Choose a real-world dataset for classification (e.g., from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository).
    *   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between the variables.
    *   Build and train a logistic regression model and a KNN model using scikit-learn.
    *   Compare the performance of the two models and discuss the results.

*   **Assignment 3: Hyperparameter Tuning for KNN**
    *   Use the dataset from Assignment 2.
    *   Perform hyperparameter tuning for the KNN model to find the optimal value of 'k'.
    *   Use techniques like grid search or randomized search.
    *   Evaluate the performance of the tuned model and compare it to the performance of the untuned model.
