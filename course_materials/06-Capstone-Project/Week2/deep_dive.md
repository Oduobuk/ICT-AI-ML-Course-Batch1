# Month 6, Week 2: Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration - Deep Dive

## Collecting and Cleaning the Dataset

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Public Datasets:** Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Google Dataset Search.
    *   **Web Scraping:** A technique for extracting data from websites.
    *   **APIs:** A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

*   **Data Cleaning:**
    *   **Handling Missing Values:** Imputation, deletion.
    *   **Handling Duplicates:** Deletion.
    *   **Handling Outliers:** Deletion, transformation.

## Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*   **Univariate Analysis:** The analysis of a single variable.
*   **Bivariate Analysis:** The analysis of the relationship between two variables.
*   **Multivariate Analysis:** The analysis of the relationship between multiple variables.

## Establishing a Baseline Model and Tracking Initial Metrics with MLflow

*   **Baseline Model:** A simple model that is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of more complex models.
*   **MLflow:** An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
*   **Tracking Initial Metrics:** Tracking the initial metrics of the baseline model will allow you to see how much the performance of the model improves as you make changes to it.
