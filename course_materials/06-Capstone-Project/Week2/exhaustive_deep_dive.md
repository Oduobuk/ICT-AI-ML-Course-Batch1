# Month 6, Week 2: Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration - Exhaustive Deep Dive

## Advanced Web Scraping

### Theoretical Explanation

Advanced web scraping techniques can be used to extract data from websites that are difficult to scrape, such as websites that use JavaScript to load content dynamically.

*   **Selenium:** A web browser automation tool that can be used to scrape websites that use JavaScript.
*   **Scrapy:** A web crawling framework that can be used to scrape websites in a structured and efficient manner.

## Data Labeling

### Theoretical Explanation

Data labeling is the process of assigning labels to data. This is a critical step in any supervised learning project.

*   **In-house Labeling:** Labeling the data yourself.
*   **Crowdsourcing:** Using a platform like Amazon Mechanical Turk to label the data.
*   **Data Labeling Services:** Using a third-party service to label the data.

## Feature Engineering

### Theoretical Explanation

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing features. This can be a very effective way to improve the performance of a machine learning model.

*   **Domain Knowledge:** Using your knowledge of the domain to create new features.
*   **Automated Feature Engineering:** Using a tool like Featuretools to automatically create new features.
