# Month 6, Week 3: Model Development and Iteration - Deep Dive

## Implementing and Comparing Various ML/DL Algorithms

*   **Algorithm Selection:**
    *   **Problem Type:** The type of problem that you are trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
    *   **Data Size:** The size of your dataset.
    *   **Data Type:** The type of your data (e.g., numerical, categorical, text, image).

*   **Model Comparison:**
    *   **Performance Metrics:** The metrics that you will use to compare the performance of the models.
    *   **Computational Complexity:** The amount of time and memory that it takes to train and run the models.
    *   **Interpretability:** The ability to understand the inner workings of the models.

## Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization

*   **Hyperparameters:** The parameters of a model that are not learned from the data. They are set by the user before the model is trained.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The process of finding the best hyperparameters for a model.
*   **Optimization Algorithms:**
    *   **Grid Search:** An exhaustive search through a grid of hyperparameters.
    *   **Random Search:** A random search through a distribution of hyperparameters.
    *   **Bayesian Optimization:** A probabilistic model-based approach to hyperparameter optimization.

## Rigorously Logging All Model Experiments, Parameters, and Results

*   **Experiment Tracking:** The process of logging all of the information about your model experiments, including the parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
*   **MLflow:** An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
*   **Benefits of Experiment Tracking:**
    *   **Reproducibility:** Makes it easy to reproduce your experiments.
    *   **Collaboration:** Allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time.
    *   **Auditing:** Provides a record of all the changes that have been made to the project.
