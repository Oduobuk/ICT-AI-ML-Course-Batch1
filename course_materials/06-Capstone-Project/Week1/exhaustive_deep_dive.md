## Project Management for Machine Learning

### Theoretical Explanation

Project management for machine learning is the process of planning, executing, and monitoring machine learning projects. It is a critical skill for any machine learning engineer or data scientist.

*   **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):** A popular project management methodology for data mining projects. It consists of six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
*   **Agile for Machine Learning:** A project management methodology that is based on the principles of agile software development. It is an iterative and incremental approach that is well-suited for machine learning projects.

## Data Governance

### Theoretical Explanation

Data governance is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data in an organization. It is a critical component of any machine learning project.

*   **Data Quality:** The degree to which the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
*   **Data Lineage:** The history of the data, from its source to its destination.
*   **Data Security:** The protection of the data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## Research and Literature Review

### Theoretical Explanation

A research and literature review is a critical step in any machine learning project. It is important to understand the state of the art in your field and to identify any gaps in the research.

*   **Google Scholar:** A search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines.
*   **arXiv:** A repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance.
