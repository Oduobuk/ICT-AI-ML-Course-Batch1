## Assignments

*   **Assignment 1: Containerize a Machine Learning Application**
    *   Choose a machine learning model that you have built in a previous assignment.
    *   Write a Dockerfile to containerize the model.
    *   Build and run the Docker container.

*   **Assignment 2: Serve a Machine Learning Model as an API**
    *   Use the model from Assignment 1.
    *   Use FastAPI or Flask to create an API for the model.
    *   Test the API to make sure that it is working correctly.

*   **Assignment 3: Explore a Cloud ML Platform**
    *   Choose one of the cloud ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, or Azure ML).
    *   Create a free account and explore the platform.
    *   Write a short summary of the features of the platform.
