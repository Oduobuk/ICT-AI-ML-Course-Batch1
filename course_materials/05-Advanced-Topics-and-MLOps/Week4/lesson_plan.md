# Month 5, Week 4: Generative Models (Introduction)

## Lesson Plan

*   **Autoencoders (AE) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE):**
    *   **Concept:** Understand the architecture of autoencoders and how they can be used for dimensionality reduction and generative modeling.
    *   **Hands-on:** Build and train an autoencoder to reconstruct images.

*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
    *   **Concept:** Understand the generator/discriminator dynamic of GANs and how they can be used to generate realistic images.
    *   **Hands-on:** Build and train a simple GAN to generate images.
