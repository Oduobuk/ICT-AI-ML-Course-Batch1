## Fairness in Machine Learning

### Theoretical Explanation

Fairness in machine learning is a complex and multifaceted topic. There are a number of different definitions of fairness, and the best definition of fairness for a particular application will depend on the specific context.

*   **Group Fairness:** Aims to ensure that the model is fair to different groups of people.
*   **Individual Fairness:** Aims to ensure that the model is fair to individuals.

## Privacy in Machine Learning

### Theoretical Explanation

Privacy in machine learning is the task of training a machine learning model without revealing sensitive information about the training data.

*   **Differential Privacy:** A mathematical definition of privacy that provides a strong guarantee of privacy.
*   **Federated Learning:** A machine learning technique that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their data.

## Security in Machine Learning

### Theoretical Explanation

Security in machine learning is the task of protecting a machine learning model from attack.

*   **Adversarial Attacks:** Attacks that are designed to fool a machine learning model.
*   **Data Poisoning Attacks:** Attacks that are designed to corrupt the training data of a machine learning model.
