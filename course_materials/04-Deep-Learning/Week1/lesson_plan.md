# Month 4, Week 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Computer Vision

## Lesson Plan

*   **Convolutional and pooling layers:** Understand the fundamental building blocks of CNNs for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
*   **Building simple CNNs for image classification (e.g., on MNIST/CIFAR-10):** Gain practical experience in constructing and training basic CNN architectures.
*   **Image augmentation techniques:** Learn methods to artificially expand the training dataset and improve model generalization.

## Assignments

*   Build and train a simple CNN to classify images from the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset. Experiment with different numbers of convolutional and pooling layers.
*   Implement various image augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, shifting, zooming) and observe their impact on the performance of your CNN, especially with limited training data.
