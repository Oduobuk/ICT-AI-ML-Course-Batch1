# Month 4, Week 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Computer Vision - Exhaustive Deep Dive

## Exhaustive Deep Dive

*   **Backpropagation in CNNs:** Understand how backpropagation works through convolutional and pooling layers, including the calculation of gradients for filters and biases.
*   **Architectural Design Principles:** Explore common design patterns and considerations for building effective CNN architectures, such as the use of 1x1 convolutions, bottleneck layers, and skip connections (conceptual introduction to ResNets).
*   **Regularization in CNNs:** Delve into regularization techniques specific to CNNs, including Dropout, Batch Normalization, and early stopping, and their role in improving generalization and training stability.
*   **Transfer Learning Mechanics:** Deepen the understanding of transfer learning, including fine-tuning, feature extraction, and when to use each approach. Discuss the importance of pre-trained weights from large datasets like ImageNet.
*   **Computational Efficiency and Hardware Acceleration:** Discuss the computational demands of CNNs and how hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) and optimized libraries (cuDNN) contribute to faster training and inference.

## Assignments

*   Implement the backpropagation algorithm for a simple convolutional layer. Demonstrate how gradients are calculated and updated.
*   Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., VGG-like, ResNet-like blocks) on a dataset. Analyze the impact of architectural choices on model performance, training time, and parameter count.
*   Research and present on the historical development of CNN architectures, highlighting key innovations from LeNet to modern architectures like EfficientNet.
