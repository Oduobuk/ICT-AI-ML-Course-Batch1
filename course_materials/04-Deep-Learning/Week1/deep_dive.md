# Month 4, Week 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Computer Vision - Deep Dive

## Deep Dive

*   **Convolutional Operation:** Delve into the mathematical details of the convolution operation, including filters/kernels, stride, padding (valid, same), and their effect on feature map dimensions. Understand how filters learn to detect specific patterns.
*   **Pooling Layers:** Explore different types of pooling (max pooling, average pooling) and their role in reducing spatial dimensions, increasing translational invariance, and controlling overfitting.
*   **CNN Architectures:** Understand the typical architecture of a CNN, including alternating convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Discuss the concept of receptive fields.
*   **Image Augmentation Techniques:** Deepen the understanding of various image augmentation techniques (e.g., random rotations, shifts, flips, brightness changes, zoom) and their importance in preventing overfitting and improving model robustness, especially with limited datasets.
*   **Data Preprocessing for Images:** Discuss essential image preprocessing steps before feeding them into a CNN, such as resizing, normalization (pixel scaling), and channel ordering.

## Assignments

*   Implement a custom convolutional layer from scratch using NumPy, demonstrating the convolution operation with different strides and padding.
*   Experiment with different image augmentation strategies on a dataset. Train a CNN with and without augmentation and compare the impact on validation accuracy and generalization.
*   Analyze the feature maps generated by early and late convolutional layers of a trained CNN. Discuss what kind of features are learned at different depths of the network.
