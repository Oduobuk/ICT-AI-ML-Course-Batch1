# Month 3, Week 3: Model Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Lesson Plan

*   **The Bias-Variance Trade-off:**
    *   **Concept:** Understand the fundamental dilemma in model building: balancing underfitting and overfitting.

*   **Cross-Validation Techniques:**
    *   **Concept:** Learn robust methods for evaluating model performance and generalization ability, including k-fold and stratified k-fold cross-validation.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to perform k-fold cross-validation.

*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
    *   **Concept:** Explore systematic and efficient ways to find the best model configurations, including Grid Search and Random Search.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use scikit-learn to perform Grid Search and Random Search for a chosen model.

*   **Experiment Tracking with MLflow:**
    *   **Concept:** Discover how to manage and compare machine learning experiments effectively.
    *   **Hands-on:** Use MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and models for different runs and compare them using the MLflow UI.
