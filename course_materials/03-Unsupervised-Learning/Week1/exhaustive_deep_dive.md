# Month 3, Week 1: Clustering - Exhaustive Deep Dive

## Spectral Clustering

### Theoretical Explanation

Spectral clustering is a graph-based clustering method that is used to find clusters in data that is not linearly separable. It works by first creating a similarity graph of the data, where the nodes are the data points and the edges are weighted by the similarity between the data points. Then, it uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering in a lower-dimensional space.

### Code Snippets

**Scikit-Learn:**

```python
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering

# Spectral Clustering
spectral_clustering = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2, affinity='nearest_neighbors')
spectral_clustering.fit(X)
```

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

### Theoretical Explanation

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are a probabilistic clustering method that assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions. The goal of GMMs is to find the parameters of the Gaussian distributions that best fit the data.

**Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm:**

The EM algorithm is an iterative algorithm that is used to find the parameters of a GMM. It consists of two steps:

1.  **Expectation Step (E-step):** Computes the probability that each data point belongs to each cluster.
2.  **Maximization Step (M-step):** Updates the parameters of the Gaussian distributions to maximize the likelihood of the data.

### Code Snippets

**Scikit-Learn:**

```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

# Gaussian Mixture Model
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2)
gmm.fit(X)
```

## Clustering High-Dimensional Data

### Theoretical Explanation

The curse of dimensionality is a phenomenon that occurs when working with high-dimensional data. It refers to the fact that the volume of the feature space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. This can make it difficult to find clusters, as all data points tend to be far away from each other.

**Solutions:**
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** A technique for reducing the number of dimensions in the data. This can be done using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE.
*   **Feature Selection:** A technique for selecting a subset of the most important features. This can be done using techniques like recursive feature elimination or forward selection.

## Fuzzy C-Means Clustering

### Theoretical Explanation

Fuzzy C-Means is a clustering algorithm that allows each data point to belong to multiple clusters with a certain degree of membership. This is in contrast to hard clustering algorithms like K-Means, where each data point can only belong to one cluster.

## Applications of Clustering

*   **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual data points that do not conform to the expected pattern.
*   **Image Segmentation:** Partitioning an image into multiple segments.
*   **Document Analysis:** Grouping documents into different topics.
