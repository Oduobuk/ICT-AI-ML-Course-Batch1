# Month 1, Week 2: Python for Data Science

**Weekly Goal:** To gain a strong command of fundamental Python
programming concepts and data structures that are the building blocks
for all data science work.

## 1. Key Concepts & Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

-   **Master Core Data Types:** Confidently use integers, floats,
    strings, and booleans.
-   **Control Program Flow:** Use loops (`for`, `while`) and
    conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to direct the logic of your
    scripts.
-   **Utilize Core Data Structures:** Understand and use lists,
    dictionaries, tuples, and sets for data storage and manipulation.
-   **Write Reusable Code with Functions:** Encapsulate logic into
    functions to make your code modular, reusable, and easier to read.
-   **Grasp Object-Oriented Principles:** Understand the basics of
    classes and objects, a fundamental paradigm in Python.
-   **Write Clean Code:** Apply basic principles of PEP 8 to write code
    that is readable and maintainable.

## 2. Lesson Content: Python Fundamentals

This week we transition from theory to practice. Python is the *lingua
franca* of data science due to its readability and the power of its
ecosystem of libraries (which we will explore next week). A rock-solid
foundation here is non-negotiable.

-   **Python's Philosophy:** We will briefly touch on the "Zen of
    Python" to understand the design principles that guide the language.
-   **Core Data Types & Variables:** How Python stores different kinds
    of information.
-   **Data Structures:** The main topic of the week. We will focus
    heavily on **lists** and **dictionaries**, as they are used
    constantly in data analysis to store and organize data.
-   **Control Flow:** The logic that allows your programs to make
    decisions and perform repetitive tasks.
-   **Functions:** The primary way we create modular and reusable code.
-   **Introduction to Classes:** A brief look into object-oriented
    programming to prepare you for working with various library objects.

## 3. Practical Labs & Exercises

This week is lab-heavy. The only way to learn programming is by writing
code. These exercises are designed to build muscle memory for key
concepts.

### a. Lab 1: Data Types and Control Flow

-   Create a new Python script named `lab_week2.py`.
-   **Exercise 1:** Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Write a
    `for` loop that iterates through this list and prints whether each
    number is "even" or "odd".
-   **Exercise 2:** Create a dictionary representing a person with keys
    "name", "age", and "city". Write a script that prints a formatted
    string: "\[Name\] is \[Age\] years old and lives in \[City\]."

### b. Lab 2: Functions

-   **Exercise 3:** Write a function `calculate_average(numbers)` that
    takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average. Test it
    with a sample list.
-   **Exercise 4:** Write a function `check_password_strength(password)`
    that takes a string as input. It should return "Strong" if the
    password is 8 characters or longer and contains at least one number.
    Otherwise, it should return "Weak".

### c.Â Lab 3: A Simple Class

-   **Exercise 5:** Create a simple `Book` class. The class should have
    an `__init__` method that takes `title` and `author` as arguments.
    It should also have a method called `display_info` that prints
    "\[Title\] by \[Author\]". Create an instance of your `Book` class
    and call the `display_info` method.

## 4. Reading Assignments

-   **Primary Reading (Beginner-Friendly):**
    -   **Book:** *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition*
        by Al Sweigart.
    -   **Chapters for this week:** This book is excellent for these
        topics.
        -   Chapter 1: Python Basics
        -   Chapter 2: Flow Control
        -   Chapter 3: Functions
        -   Chapter 4: Lists
        -   Chapter 5: Dictionaries and Structuring Data
-   **Core Text Reference:**
    -   **Book:** *Python for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition* by Wes
        McKinney.
    -   **Chapters for this week:**
        -   **Chapter 2: Python Language Basics, IPython, and Jupyter
            Notebooks:** A great, fast-paced introduction to the
            language fundamentals from a data analysis perspective.
        -   **Chapter 3: Built-in Data Structures, Functions, and
            Files:** This is the key chapter for the week. Pay close
            attention to the sections on Data Structures and Functions.

## 5. This Week's Deliverable

1.  In your `ai-ml-coursework` GitHub repository, navigate to the
    `month-1` folder.
2.  Create a new file named `week_2_lab.py`.
3.  Inside this file, add comments to delineate each exercise (e.g.,
    `# -- Exercise 1 --`) and write the code to solve all 5 lab
    exercises.
4.  Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and runs without errors.
5.  Add, commit, and push this file to your GitHub repository.
6.  **Submission:** Be prepared to share the link to your
    `week_2_lab.py` file on GitHub.
