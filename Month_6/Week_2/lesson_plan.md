# Month 6, Week 2: Lesson Plan

## Topic: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning

### Objectives:
- Understand the concepts of Monte Carlo methods for policy evaluation and control.
- Explore Temporal-Difference (TD) learning: TD(0), SARSA, and Q-learning.
- Differentiate between on-policy and off-policy learning.
- Learn about the exploration-exploitation dilemma and common strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy).

### Activities:
- Lecture on Monte Carlo methods and their application in RL.
- Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of TD learning over Monte Carlo.
- Practical exercise: Implementing Q-learning for a simple environment.
- Analysis of the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

### Homework:
- Implement SARSA for a given environment and compare its performance with Q-learning.
- Research and explain the concept of eligibility traces (TD($\lambda$)).
