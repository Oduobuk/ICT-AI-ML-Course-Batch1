# Month 6, Week 3: Exhaustive Deep Dive - Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Bridging Deep Learning and RL

Deep Reinforcement Learning combines the power of deep neural networks with the principles of reinforcement learning. This synergy allows RL agents to learn directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs (like images or raw sensor data) and to tackle complex problems that were previously intractable for traditional RL methods.

### The Need for Deep Learning in RL:
Traditional RL methods (like Q-learning or SARSA) often rely on tabular representations of states and actions, which become infeasible for environments with large or continuous state/action spaces. Deep neural networks act as powerful function approximators, enabling RL agents to generalize across vast state spaces and learn complex policies.

## Deep Q-Networks (DQN) - Value-Based DRL

DQN was a breakthrough algorithm that demonstrated how deep neural networks could successfully learn to play Atari games directly from pixel inputs, achieving human-level performance.

### Core Components of DQN:
1.  **Deep Neural Network as Q-function Approximator**: Instead of a Q-table, a deep neural network (often a CNN for visual inputs) takes the state $s$ as input and outputs the Q-values for all possible actions $a$.
    $Q(s, a; \theta) \approx Q^*(s, a)$
    Where $\theta$ are the parameters of the Q-network.

2.  **Experience Replay**: To break the strong correlations between consecutive samples and to improve data efficiency, DQN stores past experiences $(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1})$ in a **replay buffer**. During training, mini-batches of experiences are randomly sampled from this buffer.
    - **Benefits**: Reduces variance of updates, allows for re-using past experiences, and helps to decorrelate samples.

3.  **Target Network**: To stabilize the training process, DQN uses a separate **target Q-network** ($Q(s, a; \theta^-)$) with parameters $\theta^-$ that are periodically updated from the main Q-network parameters $\theta$ (e.g., every $C$ steps). The TD target is calculated using the target network:
    $Y_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(S_{t+1}, a'; \theta^-)$
    The loss function is the Mean Squared Error between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value:
    $L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim U(D)}[(Y_t - Q(s, a; \theta))^2]$

### DQN Variants:
-   **Double DQN (DDQN)**: Addresses the problem of overestimation of Q-values in standard DQN. It decouples the selection of the next action from its evaluation. The target Q-value is calculated as:
    $Y_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(S_{t+1}, \arg\max_{a'} Q(S_{t+1}, a'; \theta); \theta^-)$
-   **Dueling DQN**: Modifies the network architecture to separately estimate the state-value function $V(s)$ and the advantage function $A(s, a)$. The Q-value is then reconstructed from these two components:
    $Q(s, a) = V(s) + (A(s, a) - \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|} \sum_{a'} A(s, a'))$
    This allows the network to learn which states are valuable without having to learn the effect of each action for each state.
-   **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Instead of uniformly sampling experiences from the replay buffer, PER samples experiences with higher TD error more frequently, as these are the experiences from which the agent can learn the most.

## Policy Gradient Methods - Policy-Based DRL

Policy gradient methods directly learn a parameterized policy $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$ that maps states to actions, without explicitly learning a value function. The goal is to find the policy parameters $\theta$ that maximize the expected return.

### Policy Gradient Theorem:
The gradient of the expected return $J(\theta)$ with respect to the policy parameters $\theta$ is given by:

$\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}}[\nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(A_t|S_t) G_t]$

Where $G_t$ is the return (cumulative discounted reward) from time step $t$.

### REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient):
REINFORCE is an episodic policy gradient algorithm that uses the return from an entire episode to update the policy. It is a Monte Carlo method because it relies on complete episodes to estimate the return $G_t$.

**Update Rule for REINFORCE:
$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(A_t|S_t) G_t$

- **Baseline**: To reduce variance in the updates, a baseline (e.g., the state-value function $V(S_t)$) can be subtracted from the return $G_t$. This doesn't change the expected value of the gradient but can significantly improve learning stability.

## Actor-Critic Methods - Combining Value and Policy Learning

Actor-Critic methods combine the strengths of policy gradient (actor) and value-based methods (critic). The actor learns the policy, and the critic learns the value function to guide the actor's updates.

- **Actor**: The policy network, responsible for selecting actions. It updates its parameters based on the critic's feedback.
- **Critic**: The value network, responsible for estimating the value function (e.g., $V(s)$ or $Q(s, a)$). It evaluates the actions taken by the actor.

### Advantage Function:
Actor-Critic methods often use the **advantage function** $A(s, a) = Q(s, a) - V(s)$ to reduce variance in policy gradient updates. The advantage function indicates how much better an action is compared to the average action in a given state.

**Actor Update (using Advantage):
$\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}}[\nabla_{\theta} \log \pi_{\theta}(A_t|S_t) A(S_t, A_t)]$

## Advanced DRL Algorithms - State-of-the-Art Approaches

### A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) and A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic):
- **A3C**: A seminal algorithm that uses multiple agents exploring the environment in parallel and asynchronously updating a global network. This parallelization helps to decorrelate experiences and improves exploration and training stability.
- **A2C**: A synchronous, deterministic version of A3C, where updates are batched and performed synchronously.

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):
- **Concept**: A policy gradient method that aims to achieve the data efficiency of on-policy methods while maintaining the stability of off-policy methods. It uses a clipped surrogate objective function to prevent large policy updates, which can lead to instability.
- **Clipping**: The core idea is to clip the ratio of the new policy probability to the old policy probability, ensuring that the new policy does not deviate too much from the old one.

### DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient):
- **Concept**: An actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces. It combines ideas from DQN (experience replay, target networks) with deterministic policy gradients.
- **Actor Network**: Outputs a deterministic action for a given state.
- **Critic Network**: Estimates the Q-value for a given state-action pair.
- **Exploration**: Achieved by adding noise to the actor's output actions.
