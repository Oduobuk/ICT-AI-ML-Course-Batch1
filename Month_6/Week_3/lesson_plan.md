# Month 6, Week 3: Lesson Plan

## Topic: Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Objectives:
- Understand how deep neural networks are integrated into RL algorithms.
- Explore Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and its variants (e.g., Double DQN, Dueling DQN).
- Learn about Policy Gradient methods (e.g., REINFORCE, Actor-Critic).
- Introduce advanced DRL algorithms like A2C, A3C, PPO, and DDPG.

### Activities:
- Lecture on the challenges of high-dimensional state spaces and how DRL addresses them.
- Discussion on experience replay and target networks in DQN.
- Practical exercise: Implementing a basic DQN for a simple game environment.
- Overview of continuous control problems and DDPG.

### Homework:
- Research and compare the advantages and disadvantages of value-based vs. policy-based DRL methods.
- Implement a policy gradient method (e.g., REINFORCE) for a simple control task.
