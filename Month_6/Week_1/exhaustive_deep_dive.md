# Month 6, Week 1: Exhaustive Deep Dive - Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

## Reinforcement Learning (RL) Framework - A Comprehensive Overview

### The Agent-Environment Interface:
RL is characterized by an agent interacting with an environment over a sequence of discrete time steps. At each time step $t$:

1.  The agent observes the environment's state $S_t$.
2.  The agent selects an action $A_t$ based on its policy $\pi(A_t|S_t)$.
3.  The environment transitions to a new state $S_{t+1}$ and emits a reward $R_{t+1}$.

This interaction forms a feedback loop, where the agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

### Key Components in Detail:
- **Agent**: The entity that perceives and acts. It contains the policy and learning algorithm.
- **Environment**: Everything outside the agent. It receives actions from the agent and emits new states and rewards.
- **State ($S_t$)**: A signal from the environment that the agent uses to make decisions. It should ideally be Markovian, meaning the future is independent of the past given the present state.
- **Action ($A_t$)**: The output of the agent, influencing the environment.
- **Reward ($R_{t+1}$)**: A scalar value, the immediate feedback from the environment. It defines the goal of the RL problem.
- **Policy ($\pi$)**: The agent's behavior function. It can be deterministic ($a = \pi(s)$) or stochastic ($\pi(a|s) = P(A_t=a|S_t=s)$).
- **Value Function**: Predicts future rewards. There are two main types:
    - **State-Value Function ($V^{\pi}(s)$)**: The expected return starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$.
    - **Action-Value Function ($Q^{\pi}(s, a)$)**: The expected return starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and thereafter following policy $\pi$.

## Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Formal Definition

An MDP is a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$ where:
- $\mathcal{S}$: A finite set of states.
- $\mathcal{A}$: A finite set of actions.
- $\mathcal{P}$: State transition probability function, $P(s'|s, a) = P(S_{t+1}=s' | S_t=s, A_t=a)$. This is the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ from state $s$ after taking action $a$.
- $\mathcal{R}$: Reward function, $R(s, a, s') = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} | S_t=s, A_t=a, S_{t+1}=s']$. This is the expected immediate reward received after transitioning from $s$ to $s'$ via action $a$.
- $\gamma \in [0, 1]$: Discount factor, which determines the present value of future rewards. A value of 0 makes the agent myopic, while a value close to 1 makes it far-sighted.

### Return ($G_t$):
The total discounted reward from time step $t$ is called the return:
$G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$

## The Bellman Equations - Derivations and Significance

### Bellman Expectation Equations:
These equations describe the value functions for a given policy $\pi$.

- **State-Value Function ($V^{\pi}(s)$)**:
$V^{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^{\pi}(s')]$ 
This equation states that the value of a state $s$ under policy $\pi$ is the expected immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of the next state $s'$, averaged over all possible actions $a$ and next states $s'$.

- **Action-Value Function ($Q^{\pi}(s, a)$)**:
$Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma \sum_{a'} \pi(a'|s') Q^{\pi}(s', a')]$ 
This equation states that the value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ under policy $\pi$ is the expected immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of the next state-action pair, averaged over all possible next states $s'$ and actions $a'$.

### Bellman Optimality Equations:
These equations describe the value functions for the optimal policy $\pi^*$.

- **Optimal State-Value Function ($V^*(s)$)**:
$V^*(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^*(s')]$ 
This means the optimal value of a state is the maximum expected return achievable by taking the best action from that state.

- **Optimal Action-Value Function ($Q^*(s, a)$)**:
$Q^*(s, a) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a')]$ 
This means the optimal value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ is the expected immediate reward plus the discounted maximum expected value of the next state-action pair.

## Dynamic Programming (DP) for Solving MDPs

DP methods are a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment (i.e., known transition probabilities $\mathcal{P}$ and reward function $\mathcal{R}$). They are typically used for planning.

### Policy Iteration:
Policy Iteration consists of two alternating phases:

1.  **Policy Evaluation**: Given a policy $\pi$, compute the state-value function $V^{\pi}(s)$. This is done by iteratively applying the Bellman expectation equation until $V^{\pi}(s)$ converges.
    $V_{k+1}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V_k(s')]$ 

2.  **Policy Improvement**: Given the value function $V^{\pi}(s)$, improve the policy by making it greedy with respect to $V^{\pi}(s)$. For each state $s$, the new policy $\pi'(s)$ selects the action $a$ that maximizes $Q^{\pi}(s, a)$.
    $\pi'(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^{\pi}(s')]$ 

These two steps are repeated until the policy no longer changes, at which point the optimal policy and value function have been found.

### Value Iteration:
Value Iteration directly computes the optimal value function $V^*(s)$ by iteratively applying the Bellman optimality equation until convergence.

$V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V_k(s')]$ 

Once $V^*(s)$ has converged, the optimal policy $\pi^*(s)$ can be derived by choosing the action that maximizes the expected return from each state:

$\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^*(s')]$ 

### Comparison of Policy Iteration and Value Iteration:
- **Policy Iteration**: Guarantees convergence to the optimal policy in a finite number of iterations. Each iteration involves a full policy evaluation, which can be computationally expensive.
- **Value Iteration**: Also guarantees convergence. It can be more efficient than policy iteration in some cases as it doesn't require a full policy evaluation at each step.

## Model-Based vs. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning - A Deeper Dive

- **Model-Based RL**: These approaches explicitly learn or are provided with a model of the environment. The model predicts the next state and reward given the current state and action. This model can then be used for planning (e.g., by simulating future interactions) to determine optimal policies.
    - **Advantages**: Can be sample efficient (learns from fewer interactions), allows for planning without real-world interaction.
    - **Disadvantages**: Learning an accurate model can be challenging, and errors in the model can propagate.

- **Model-Free RL**: These approaches learn directly from experience (trial and error) without explicitly learning a model of the environment. They typically learn value functions or policies directly.
    - **Advantages**: Simpler to implement, can handle complex environments where a model is difficult to learn.
    - **Disadvantages**: Often less sample efficient (requires more interactions), can be harder to explore effectively.
