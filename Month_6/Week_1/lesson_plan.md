# Month 6, Week 1: Lesson Plan

## Topic: Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

### Objectives:
- Understand the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL): agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, policies, and value functions.
- Differentiate between model-based and model-free RL.
- Explore the Bellman equation and its role in optimal control.
- Introduce dynamic programming methods for solving RL problems (Policy Iteration, Value Iteration).

### Activities:
- Lecture on the RL framework and key terminology.
- Discussion on real-world applications of RL.
- Introduction to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
- Walkthrough of Policy Iteration and Value Iteration with simple examples.

### Homework:
- Implement Policy Iteration or Value Iteration for a small grid-world problem.
- Research and summarize a classic RL paper (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA).
