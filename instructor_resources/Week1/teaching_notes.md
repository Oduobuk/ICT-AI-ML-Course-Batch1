# Week 1 Teaching Notes

## Key Concepts
1. **Introduction to AI/ML**
   - Difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning
   - Types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
   - Real-world applications and ethical considerations

2. **Python for Data Science**
   - NumPy arrays and operations
   - Pandas DataFrames and Series
   - Data cleaning and manipulation

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train-test split
   - Model training process
   - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
   - Overfitting and underfitting

## Common Pitfalls

### Concept Understanding
- Students often confuse AI and ML terms
- Difficulty understanding the bias-variance tradeoff
- Challenges in selecting appropriate evaluation metrics

### Technical Issues
- Problems with Python environment setup
- Confusion between NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames
- Issues with data types and missing values

### Coding Challenges
- Inefficient data processing with loops instead of vectorized operations
- Forgetting to handle missing values
- Misunderstanding DataFrame indexing and selection

## Teaching Strategies

### Active Learning
- Start with real-world examples before diving into theory
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for live coding demonstrations
- Include think-pair-share activities for concept discussions

### Hands-on Practice
- Provide starter code for exercises
- Include debugging exercises
- Encourage pair programming for complex tasks

### Assessment
- Use formative assessments during lessons
- Provide immediate feedback on coding exercises
- Include both theoretical and practical components in quizzes

## Discussion Points

### Ethical Considerations
- Bias in machine learning models
- Privacy concerns with data collection
- Impact of AI on jobs and society

### Real-world Applications
- How companies use ML in production
- Case studies of successful ML projects
- Common challenges in ML projects
